# README.md

This is a test of our real application. For this project, we are going to use ReactJS. All the future libraries used on the Front-End are going to be installed using npm (mixing npm with yarn could crash the application, USE NPM, DO NOT USE YARN). 

Do not push or pull request to `main`. Create your own branch and push your branch to the repository. This in order to know that the application works on all computers using different operating systems.

To set up the application, once you have the clone on your computer, run:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`


Make some changes to the application without breaking it (adding some lines of code, creating a component, etc), and pull request your changes.

We can always fork the repo and keep, this would be a better way of contribute as a team.

 # UI Library - Ant Design

Any problem do not hesitate to ask. Happy coding!
